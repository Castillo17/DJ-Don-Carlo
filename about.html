            <p> Karen Osorio "We had Dj Don Carlo lead our event this past weekend for my son's baptisim/ birthday. They were amazing trough the whole process, from following up with us since day one to the end. He was very professional and really cared to take in consideration what our expectations were. During the event they really tried to involve every guest to participate and have fun. He was great! I would highly recommend him to anyone that's having anything from a small to huge event."</p>
